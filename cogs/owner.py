    If the bot is ever scaled to many guilds, then it would be a good idea
    to use `guild_ids` in the slash command decorator to specify that these
    commands should only be registered to specific guilds.
    Furthermore, to only allow certain users to even access the 'owner' slash
    commands group, go to the server(s) in which the commands are registered,
    then go to:
        - Server Settings > Integrations > Bots and Apps >
        {Name of your bot} Manage > Commands > /owner
        - Click 'Add roles or members' and select the '@everyone' role
        - Select the red 'X' for the '@everyone' override
        - Click 'Add roles or members' and add yourself
        - Select the green check for yourself
